Implement try/ catch blocks and error messages
Check that method comments are up to date
Figure out if ListBooks/Authors/GEnres/etc should not all implement an interface, and if so whther they can
	aka if implementation can have a restriction of type for method type / parameters for example from object to
	book
Maybe Author, Genre and Shelf should implement some kind of interface to reflect the fact that they all 
	hold a list of books and have behavior relating to that ? but same problem as above.
	
Should I use an interface for any other orthogonal thing?
